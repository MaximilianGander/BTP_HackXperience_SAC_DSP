This workshop takes place in SAP Data Warehouse Cloud and SAP Analytics Cloud. First of all, internal data is combined with external data from the Data Marketplace. Afterwards, a connection to SAP Analytics Cloud is set up using the DWC Public Consumption API. After loading the data from the previously created union to SAP Analytics Cloud, a story in SAP Analytics Cloud is enriched with the respective tables for data entry and simulation before we then create the needed objects like the predictive scenario, multi actions and data actions. After running the prediction and saving the results into a planning version, we set up a connection and load data to SAP Data Warehouse Cloud using the Data Export Service offered by SAP Analytics Cloud.

In the Data Builder of SAP Data Warehouse Cloud, you can define data models for your data with a technical, model-driven approach in the graphical tools or in the powerful SQL editor of the data layer. Two Data Builder artefacts have been pre-created for this workshop.

- A table containing cash flow statement actuals from S/4HANA
- A view on top of this table

## 0.3 SAP Data Warehouse Cloud - Data Marketplace
Data Marketplace is fully integrated into SAP Data Warehouse Cloud. Itâ€™s tailored for businesses to easily integrate third-party data. You can search and purchase analytical data from data providers. The data comes in form of objects packaged as data products that can be used in one or several spaces of your SAP Data Warehouse Cloud tenant.

Data products are either provided for free or require the purchase of a license at a certain cost. Some data products are available as one-time shipments, other data products are regularly updated by data providers.

To get data products into your SAP Data Warehouse Cloud tenant and consume them, you can follow a simple workflow:
