# Exercise 1 - Acquiring Data from SAP Data Warehouse Cloud

In this exercise, we first look for external data on energy prices in the Data Marketplace of SAP Data Warehouse Cloud. We will then combine this data with our internal cash flow statement actuals and create a consumable view. Finally, we create a connection from SAP Analytics Cloud to SAP Data Warehouse Cloud that will allow us to easily transfer the data into a planning model. 

## Exercise 1.1 Adding External Data via Data Marketplace

After completing these steps you will have created an Analytical Dataset in SAP Data Warehouse Cloud, which combines external data from Data Marketplace with internal actuals. 

1. First, let us navigate to the Data Marketplace. As the name suggests, it is like a marketplace for data consumers and data providers, and allows the easy integration of external data. If this is news to you, feel free to explore the various data products that are available.
