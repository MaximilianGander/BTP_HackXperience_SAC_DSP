## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2022 session called DA280 - Build an Integrated Planning Scenario with Data and Analytics Solutions.  

## Overview

In this session, we will build an end-to-end integrated planning application with SAP Data Warehouse Cloud and SAP Analytics Cloud using the bi-directional data transfer between the two solutions. Besides the data transfer, the session covers data modeling, including the data marketplace in SAP Data Warehouse Cloud, as well as the creation of a planning model with predictive analytics and the respective front end for data entry.
